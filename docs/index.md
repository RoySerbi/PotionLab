# EASS – Engineering of Advanced Software Solutions (12-Session Plan)

Welcome! This site hosts the 12-week plan for the EASS (Engineering of Advanced Software Solutions) course reboot. Everything is organized around short theory bursts followed by two hands-on blocks so undergrads can follow step by step.

- Classes meet on **Mondays** from **02/03/2026** through **01/06/2026** (Semester B 2026).
- Each meeting has **45 min theory** + **45 min hands-on build** + **45 min practice/extension**.
- Exercises are assigned in class with weekday deadlines that avoid Shabbat and official holiday closures.
- Cloud prerequisite uses **AWS Educate** self-paced training at https://www.awseducate.com/ (free, no credit card required).

> **Heads-up from Andrej Karpathy**  
> - Sleep beats all-nighters; aim for ~7½ hours before big work.  
> - Meet the material early and often—short sessions across days stick best.  
> - Try problems without notes so you know you can re-create the steps.  
> - Teach someone else what you learned; explaining makes it click.  
> - Visit office hours and sessions even if you only have small questions.  
> - Stop studying alone near the end—compare notes and fill gaps with peers.  
> - Never hand in early on tests; use every minute to check for silly misses.  
> - Grades matter, but real projects and references matter more—build things outside class.

## Future-facing Engineering Archetypes
Modern software careers are coalescing around four complementary builder profiles, and EASS intentionally lets students rehearse each mindset while staying within an approachable scope.

1. **Field / Business Engineer (the people person)** – Owns discovery conversations, trims prototypes to the sharpest business value, and turns demos into “this solves your problem” stories.
2. **DevOps & Infrastructure Engineer (the reliability guru)** – Keeps systems observable and shippable; in this course that means Docker Compose fluency, health checks, and deterministic deploys for every lab.
3. **Full-stack Product Engineer (the end-to-end builder)** – Ships UI, API, and data layers together. FastAPI, Streamlit, and shared models appear across sessions so students get repeated reps on this archetype.
4. **AI Full-stack Engineer (the intelligence layer)** – Orchestrates services that learn and act safely. Session 08’s agent labs and the optional MCP/DuckDB tracks show how to wire data contracts for AI-heavy features.

**Course promise**: graduate students who are day-one ready for archetypes 3–4, while giving them enough automation/infra reps to be a smart bet for archetype 2 if a team decides to mentor them. We keep archetype 1 in view by narrating every build in stakeholder language, not just in console output.

## Exercises at a Glance
- **EX1 – FastAPI Foundations (Backend)**: assigned **Monday, 16/03/2026** · due **Monday, 30/03/2026 at 23:59 (Israel time)**. Build the FastAPI CRUD API + tests from Session 03; add Session 04’s SQLite persistence as soon as you’re ready so the service is EX3-ready.
- **EX2 – Friendly Interface (Frontend connected to Backend)**: assigned **Monday, 27/04/2026** · due **Monday, 18/05/2026 at 23:59 (Israel time)**. Add a Streamlit dashboard or Typer CLI that calls the EX1 API.
- **EX3 – Full-Stack Microservices Final Project (KISS)**: assigned **Monday, 25/05/2026** · final submission window opens **Monday, 29/06/2026** · final due **Wednesday, 01/07/2026 at 23:59 (Israel time)**. Integrate the API, dedicated persistence layer, interface, and async/Redis worker into a multi-service stack, add one small improvement, and document the runbook + Compose workflow. Everything stays local—`uv run` + `docker compose up`, no cloud hosting required.
- **Choose your own theme:** the sessions demonstrate a movie service, but students pick any narrow domain on Day 1 and carry it through all three exercises.
- Sessions 9–12 continue the main storyline by hardening async flows, multi-service orchestration, security, and tool-friendly polish—each reinforces EX3 readiness while keeping the graded scope local and manageable.

## Teaching Philosophy
- Build every example live from the session scripts (no pre-solved `examples/` folders) so changes stay in sync and the cohort can follow the exact steps. Keep snippets tiny and copy/paste friendly when time is tight.
- Repeat concepts using the whiteboard sketches described in each session and the Natalie reference notes in `old-lecture-notes/notes/`.
- Keep optional extras (MCP workshop, DuckDB lab, blockchain demo) clearly labeled so students know the graded work stays lightweight and local.
- Encourage question “warm-ups”: students share what they tried before asking for help.

Happy teaching!
